## Version
0.1.240424

## Why such a weird version numbering?
It's in early development. I took a long break from the project, when i came back, a lot was already present, so im assuming this to be `0.1`. However, since then, not enough has changed to warrant a new number, so i use the date in YYMMDD format to differenciate the progress.
